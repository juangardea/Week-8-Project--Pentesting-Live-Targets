# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

-In the "Salesperson" section, if you inject ' to the end of the URL, the green and red site will redirect to the same page but the blue site will display "Database query failed"


## Green

Vulnerability #1:User Enumeration

- If I attempt to log-in with user account and random password that does not exist, the site will give message that "Log in was unsuccessful." The site will give away the vulnerabilty when you try to log-in with a valid user account and wrong password, it will give 'Log in was unssuccessful" in bold letters while the message is not in bold letter if the account is not a valid one. 


Vulnerability #2: XSS

-XSS script can be entered in the Contact Us feedback form. It will execute the script when the admin account logs in to view the feedback submitted by users. 

## Red

Vulnerability #1: IDOR
<img src="https://github.com/juangardea/Week-8-Project--Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/red_vulnerability1.gif">
- "id=" in the URL can be modified. It seems that public accessble data end at id=9. If you try id=10 or id=11 you can view data that is not intended to be viewed by the public.
